# Killer Kitty Source Files

This is a product of the Indie Game Dev Beginners #002 (https://itch.io/jam/indie-game-dev-beginners-002).  

Project was made in Unity 2021.3.11f1

Itch.io page of the latest release: (https://sinithparanga.itch.io/killerkitty).

All sprites and animations were done by daugther and me. 
Some coding was taken from the web.

It took as some days to do this game, so the code is messy and unstructured.


Hope you enjoy the game.
